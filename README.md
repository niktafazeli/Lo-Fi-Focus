# Lo-Fi-Focus
General Information - the project reworks low-fidelity music into a personalised musical composition. This will directly help university students like myself, balance academic pressures by creating a calm studying atmosphere that enhances focus

Technology used - TunePad across all three compositions 

Features - all musical compositions are designed to play in a loop as background music 

Setup - downlad either the MP3 or JSON files and click play 

Project status - complete 

Room for improvement - enhance the complexities of the code, add a Processing element of meditative animation to complemennt the musical compositions (was in progress but not satisfactory for submission) 

Acknowledgements - this project was inspired by lo-fi elements from this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APljvOxetas and used https://learn.tunepad.com/ for referncing of code
